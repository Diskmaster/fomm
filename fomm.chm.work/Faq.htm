<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><b>If I use fomm to manage my load order, do I always need to launch fallout with it?</b>
<br>
No. fomm's launch fallout button is provided purely as a convenience, and there is never any circumstance where its use is required.
<br>

<br>
<b>Is fomm compatible with fose?</b>
<br>
Yes. The programs both do two completely different things, so there are no issues between them at all. If you haven't set a custom launch command, when fose is installed fomm will automatically launch it rather than starting fallout directly. The 'launch fallout' button text will also change to 'launch fose' to show that fomm has recognised that fose is installed.
<br>

<br>
<b>Why are none of my mods checked in the official launcher?</b>
<br>
The official launcher is bugged; accessing the data files menu automatically deactivates all mods except for fallout3.esm. Using the official launcher for other tasks such as modifing the graphics settings is fine, but avoid the data files menu if you are using any mods.
<br>

<br>
<b>How do I fix the error "Unable to get write permissions for fallout's installation directory"?</b>
<br>
You will get this error if you're using windows vista or windows 7 and have installed fallout to the program files folder. Moddable games should never be installed to this folder under these operating systems. If you don't feel like reinstalling, you have two other options: either disable UAC, (type 'disable uac' into google and follow the first link) or find every exe belonging to either fallout or a utility of it, right click, go to the compatibility tab and check the 'run as administrator' option. (At the minimum if you have no other tools installed, that will include fallout3.exe, FalloutLauncher.exe, fomm.exe and 7za.exe in the /fomm folder.)
