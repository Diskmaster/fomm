    <font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">The top left hand box contains a
      list of all your currently installed fomods, which checkboxes indicating
      which are active. Note that 'installed' and 'active' have different
      meanings for fomods to individual plugins; an installed plugin is one
      which exists in fallout's data folder, and an active one is one which
      fallout is actually using. An installed fomod is one which exists in
      fomm's fomod storage directory, and an active fomod is one which has been
      unpacked by fomm into fallout's data directory. Right clicking on a fomod
      provides some additional options.
      <br>
      <br>
      the fomod list has two modes. In the default mode, all fomods are listed
      in a flat line. In the second mode, they are arranged by groupings, such
      as items, quest mods, etc. One fomod can be part of multiple groups. Use
      the 'Display groups' checkbox to alternate between groups.
      <br>
      <br>
      The box below contains the description of the current fomod, or is blank
      if the fomod contains no description. Similaly, the top right hand box
      contains a screenshot or other representative image of the selected fomod
      if it contains one.
      <br>
      <br>
      The activate/deactivate button is used to activate and deactivate fomods.
      'Add new' is used to add additional fomods into fomm. Mods with the file
      extensions .fomod, .zip, .rar and .7z are supported. fomods will be copied
      straight into the fomm's mod directory without modification. Other
      archives will be unpacked and repacked, to allow for fomm to check for
      things which may require a scripting install, or misnamed readme's etc.
      (Note that mods with the extension '.fomod.zip' are treated specially;
      fomm assumes that the mod is already in the correct fomod format, and
      doesn't attempt to unpack and repack it like it will do with other zip
      files.)
      <br>
      <br>
      View readme will display and allow modification of the mod's readme if it
      exists. (Note that readmes in html format can be viewed only, and cannot
      be modified from inside fomm.)
      <br>
      <br>
      Edit script will display and allow modification of the script attached to
      the fomod.
      <br>
      <br>
      Edit info is used to edit metadata attached to the mod, such as name,
      author, description, etc. You also edit which groups the fomod belongs in
      from here.
      <br>
      <br>
      Edit groups allows you to edit the groups that fomm uses to arrange
      fomods. You can add aditional groups, as well as remove any of the default
      groups.
