<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The first screen that displays when you open fomm is a list of your active plugins and their load order. Plugins can be activated/deactivated by clicking the checkboxes. Selecting a plugin will show that plugins details in the text box below, and the screenshot, (if any,) in the box on the top right. Load order can be modified by drag/dropping, and multiple plugins can be selected using the standard ctrl/shift method if groups of plugins need to be reordered at once.
<br>

<br>
Along the right hand side are buttons for accessing the other parts of fomm. 'Launch fallout' launches fallout, (the game itself, not the launcher,) and will launch via fose if it is installed. 'Toggle invalidation' will install or remove a redirection BSA to avoid archiveinvalidation issues. The other buttons each open their respective utilities. The one you're likely to use the most is the package manager, which handles the installation and removal of fomods.
