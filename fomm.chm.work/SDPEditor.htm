<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">This is used for editing the .sdp files that contain all of fallout's shaders. Click 'open' and browse to a shader package to get started.
<br>

<br>
At any time 'Close' will close the sdp without saving changes, and 'Save' will bring up the save dialog to let you pick a file to save to. (fomm will <i>not</i> automatically overwrite your original file without you explicitely telling it to.)
<br>

<br>
The combobox on the bottom left has a list of available shaders in the sdp. Pick one, and its dissassembly will be displayed. (As the shaders are stored in a compiled form, there is no HLSL available.) Edit the shader and hit compile to modify it.
<br>

<br>
Clicking import/export gives a list of options. Import HLSL will replace the currently selected shader with a HLSL shader, and Import binary will do the same with a .pso/.vso compiled shader. Export binary exports the currently selected shader as a .pso or .vso (these can be used in fomods by the shader replacer script functions,) and export binary all will export every shader in the sdp as .vso's and .pso's.
